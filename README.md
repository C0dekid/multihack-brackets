# multihack-brackets
Synchronizes code and project structure between multiple users in realtime.

## Usage
1. **File > Start Multihack**  
2. Enter your desired room ID.  
3. Click **Join Room**. Your code is now being synchronized!
4. **File > Stop Multihack** will stop collaboration.

This project currently only syncs *changes* in code. You will need to start with the same code on joining the room. (This may change as the project develops.)
